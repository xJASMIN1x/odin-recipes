        <h3><i>Light and moist dairy-free cupcakes with a pleasant aroma that I invented on the spot.
             They are delicious, not too sweet, and easy to make. Top with your frosting of choice or

            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¾ cup applesauce</li>
            <li>½ cup coconut milk</li>

        <ol>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 10 cups of a muffin tin or 
                line with paper muffin liners.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Combine all-purpose flour, sugar, coconut flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, 
                and nutmeg together in a bowl.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Whisk egg lightly in a large bowl. Add applesauce, coconut milk, vegetable oil, 
                honey, and vanilla extract. Stir in flour mixture until batter is just combined. 
                Scoop into the prepared muffin pan.</li>    
                <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and a 
                toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.</li>    
        </ol>
